    You are going to have to generate a key.
    create a home page where you ask the visitor to enter the city of his choice.

Sprint 2

    Get the weather data using axios or another javascript AJAX enabled library or use the native JS fetch() method
    Optional: Use a cdn link to link axios to your project.
    Display the weather for the next 5 days. Show the averages per day.
    Apply styling to your project using media queries to make it responsive.

Extra challenges
